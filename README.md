# Airbus_Wind_Turbines

In this project, we are trying to build some classifiers in order to discriminate (classify) wind turbines from grounds.

### We are essentially using two methods in order to achieve our goal.
    - The first one is to build a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) from scratch.
    - The second one is to use transfer learning (feature extraction).
    
### Result of the experiment

#### CNN from scratch:
    - Test Accuracy: 98.76 % (over 3 epochs)
    - Test Loss: 5.33 % (over 3 epochs)
#### MobileNetV2 - Transfer Learning (feature extraction)
    - Test Accuracy: 98.36 % (over 1 epoch)
    - Test Loss: 4.78 % (over 1 epoch)
